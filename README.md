## Game Design

### Title of Your Game: Finding a Way Home
### Describe the game: The goal is to find the correct path between two cities. There are multiple cities or nodes with multiple paths connecting them.
### Each agent has select information on which cities are connected via differing paths i.e. [city A->B], [city B->E].



## Agent Design

### What makes this game a test of agentic behavior?
### Each agent has different information and must reason with each other to determine the correct path. 
### Did you design for any specific types of agents or capabilities?
### Contraints used - All messages are truncated. Each agent has different information on the paths.
### How does success or failure reflect the agentâ€™s performance?
### Success in finding the path means that the agents are able to reason and form a strategy of determining the correct path.

## Evaluation

### Emergent Language: Did the language exhibit surprising depth? Did these properties emerge naturally, without being explicitly instructed?
### Yes, the models began making statements not knowing their language would be truncated, and slowly evolved shorter statements as a result. They were bad at sharing information.
### Task Completion: How successfully and efficiently did the agents complete the game objectives?
### could have been more efficient
### Domain Realism: Does your game represent a realistic coordination challenge? Why or why not?
### Yes, because path finding between cities is relevent


## Additional Questions

### If you had more time, how would you improve or enhance this game?
